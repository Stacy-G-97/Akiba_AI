```typescript
// Example: Track sales patterns
const salesData = await DataService.getHistoricalSales(30);
// Analyzes: quantity sold, time patterns, seasonal trends
```

#### 2. **Weather API Integration**
```typescript
// Example: Weather impact on demand
const weather = await DataService.getWeatherData(7);
// Considers: temperature, rainfall, humidity effects on food choices
```

#### 3. **Local Event Calendars**
```typescript
// Example: Event impact analysis
const events = await DataService.getLocalEvents(14);

const sentiment = await DataService.getSocialSentiment(7);
// Monitors: mentions, sentiment, trending foods, customer preferences
```

### Machine Learning Engine

The `PredictionEngine` combines all data sources:

```typescript
// Example: Generate smart predictions
const prediction = await PredictionEngine.generateDemandPrediction('Sukuma Wiki', 3);
// Returns: predicted demand, confidence level, contributing factors
```
